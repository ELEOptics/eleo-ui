**Breaking:** `data.layout` and `data.layoutWl` are now recorded layouts, `{surfaces, rays, chief?}`, instead of a bare rays array (and `{field, rays}`), and `layout2D` throws on the old shape. To migrate, record each surface with its `profile` and `glass` and move the old rays array to `rays`: see the plots README's `### Migration` section. New: `layoutBounds`; `layout2D` takes `box`, `labels`, `marks` and reads a recorded `chief`; the types `RecordedLayout`, `RecordedSurface`, `LayoutBox` and `LayoutSystem`; and the `./eleo-layout.js` export (`layout2D` and `layoutBounds` alone). `@eleoptics/plots-svelte` widens its `@eleoptics/plots` peer range to `>=0.1.0 <1`, so it accepts the new plots.
