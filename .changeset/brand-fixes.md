Index colors follow a pinned field order per palette: `--series-1` to `--series-8` map to fields for the standard, red-green and blue-yellow palettes (`<html data-palette>`), every renderer colors through them, and the segmented control marks its selection in glass instead of amber. Svelte canvases redraw on a palette change.
