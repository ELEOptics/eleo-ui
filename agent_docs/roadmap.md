# Roadmap: <title>

Status: active | done YYYY-MM-DD
Goal: one or two sentences, in the user's words.
ADRs: the decisions every plan on this roadmap inherits.

The one living roadmap of this repo: the only agent_docs artifact edited and appended as work lands. The
planner scopes the next plan from it; the orchestrator ticks the plan's row at plan end. A goal that needs
several plans is a group of rows under its own `### <goal>` heading in Plans. Done rows stay one line.

## Outcomes

What the roadmap delivers, each with the oracle its acceptance test will cite (`<kind> <source>`, kinds in
workflow.md TDD > Oracles). Agents propose the oracles; the user approves the column in one batch.

| ID | Outcome | Oracle | Plan |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| R1 |  | `<kind> <source>` | #<n> |

## Plans

In order. A row becomes a plan (`agent_docs/plans/<n>-<slug>.md`) only when it is next.

Row letters and the Plan column: `agent_docs/agents/workflow.md`, Artifacts (Roadmap).

| Row | Plan | Scope | Exit criterion | Status |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A | #<n> |  |  | done YYYY-MM-DD / active / next / later |

## Decision rights

Who decides what. The default below; change a row only with the user. Anything not listed goes one level up.

| Decision | Owner |
| -- | -- |
| How to implement an item inside its Files | worker |
| Split, CR triage, commit order, wave dispatch | orchestrator |
| Choose, add or reorder rows (`/roadmap next`), milestone acceptance within the plan | director |
| Merge a plan PR that `director/merge.sh` accepts | director |
| Security triggers, superseding an ADR, deviating from this roadmap, changing an oracle or acceptance test, adding a dependency, disputes after two rounds | user |

## Design references

What the UI must look like: screenshots, Figma or Design-canvas links, tokens, apps to match. Each UI
outcome names the baseline the user approves; that baseline is its oracle (`user <artifact>`).

| Outcome | Reference | Baseline |
| -- | -- | -- |
| R<k> |  | approved YYYY-MM-DD / pending |

## Kill criteria

Per row, the signal that makes the agent stop and ask the user whether to pivot. Measurable where possible.

| Row | Signal | Ask |
| -- | -- | -- |
| #<n> / R<k> |  | pivot, cut, or continue? |

## Shared tables

Anything several plans draw from and that changes as they land (a hook list, a unit order, a catalog
coverage table). Each row names the plan that delivers it.

## Change log

One bullet per entry (bare lines render as one paragraph).

- YYYY-MM-DD: what changed and why (a plan finished, a CR re-ordered the rows).
